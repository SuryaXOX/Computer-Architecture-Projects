# Computer-Architecture
Implemented a 5-stage pipelined architecture for WISC-SP13 processor, all written in Verilog. Takes care of pipeline hazards using data forwarding, stalls or branch prediction. Optimized the processor by adding a cache and improved CPI. Cache creates a direct-mapped cache and a two-way set associative cache.
